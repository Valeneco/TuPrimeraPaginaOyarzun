        <h2>Hi! I'm Valentina</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a developer in training and a finance professional working for a language interpretation 
            and translation company. Since the company operates internationally, I manage multiple 
            platforms to track collections and expenses. This motivated me to learn system development, 
            aiming to create efficient solutions for real-world financial management challenges.

        <h3>🚀 About Our Platform</h3>
        <p>
            This platform is an Integrated Financial Management System designed to streamline and secure 
            the administration of our Accounts Payable (AP) and Accounts Receivable (AR). Our mission is 
            to provide a transparent, efficient, and centralized environment for all financial transactions 
            involving our customers and vendors.
        </p>

        <h4>How It Works</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Customers (AR):</strong> Can view and monitor their outstanding invoices. Invoice creation/editing is handled by internal staff.</li>
            <li><strong>Vendors (AP):</strong> Can create/manage invoices for goods or services provided. Payment status changes are restricted to internal staff.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The platform serves as the authoritative, real-time repository for tracking our organization's 
            financial obligations and rights.
